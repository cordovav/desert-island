    <p>My island is quite small. It is located just of the coast of long island.
        We have an abundance of coconuts and mango tree.
        There is alot of firewood to help keep me warm at night.
        There is no civilization on my island. I live in a hut made of mud and leaves.
        My Island is located in the Atlantic Ocean
        The weather is quite warm and hot during the day and cool at night.
        This is a tiny volcano located on the south of the island.
        Some days there is smoke coming out.
        The only animals around at the moment are eagles, and squirrels.
        I have heard loud growls at night, it could be bears or wolves, i wouldnt want to know.
